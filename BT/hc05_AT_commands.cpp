/*To change the password and name of an HC-05 Bluetooth module dynamically using Arduino code
, you can send AT commands to the module through the serial interface. Here's an example code that will change the name and password of the module:*/

scss
Copy code
#include <SoftwareSerial.h>

SoftwareSerial BTserial(2, 3); // RX | TX

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);  // Serial port for debugging
  BTserial.begin(38400);  // HC-05 default baud rate
}

void loop() {
  // Send AT command to change the name of the module
  BTserial.print("AT+NAME=NewName\r\n"); // Change NewName to your desired name
  delay(1000);

  // Send AT command to change the password of the module
  BTserial.print("AT+PSWD=1234\r\n"); // Change 1234 to your desired password
  delay(1000);
}

/*
Note that the default password for the HC-05 module is "1234". You can replace the "NewName" and "1234" values in the code with your desired name and password, respectively.

Also, make sure that the RX and TX pins of the HC-05 module are connected to the correct pins on the Arduino (usually pin 2 for RX and pin 3 for TX).

Once you upload the code to the Arduino, open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE and set the baud rate to 9600. You should see the output of the HC-05 module responding to the AT commands being sent. If the name and password are successfully changed, you should see the new name and password being displayed in the Serial Monitor.
