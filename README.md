# Smart Lock/Bike ArduinoPoject

Our solution aims to make the transport of students, teachers and all users of the USTHB very fast and reliable
Given the shortness of their time between sessions to change classrooms. 
We allow app users to reserve bikes in advance and use NFC technology to unlock them, which is faster than the QR code method.
We also use phone geolocation to track users and keep bikes safe.



# Things to improve in the future
# 1-make the code modular and easy to to edit via functions
# 2-make the code more secure using tests before executing functions
# 3-make the code dynamique ( next milestone)



# Black is + ( Ground )
# Red is - (Has power)
